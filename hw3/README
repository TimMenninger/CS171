From the top directory, compile by running
$ make

Then, the binary is put into the bin/ directory.  Thus, to run, we call
$ ./bin/opengl_shader <some_file> <xres> <yres>
where examples of <some_file> can be found as .txt files in the data/
directory.

Example (from top directory):
$ make
$ ./bin/opengl_shader data/scene_cube2.txt 500 500
