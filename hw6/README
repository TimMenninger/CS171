Part 1:
I wasn't totally sure how to get the lighting in such a way that the I-bar
was in color, but hopefully that wasn't too large a component of what we were
to do... Press 'n' to go to the next frame.  Run it with

    ./keyframe [script] [xres] [yres]

as described in the 2016 CS171 HW6 prompt.


Part 2:
For whatever reason I thought it'd be cool to multi-thread it, so sorry if
that degrades readability.  At the same time, hopefully it will improve runtime
(although I wouldn't know as I haven't run it on one thread).  Anyway, to run
this, go

    ./interpolate < [info]

where info is a file that describes what to do.  The format should have the
output directory on line 1, the "base name", or what goes to the left of the
frame number, on line 2, then the remaining lines should be lines with two
elements: a keyframe and the frame in the movie that keyframe represents.
These should be in chronological order.  For the bunny*.obj, I created
keyframes.txt to run.
