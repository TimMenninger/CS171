This is made with a simple "make" and is run as described in the homework.

Use 'l' (as in Laplace) to smooth.

Explanation of thought process for part 2 can be found in file header on
src/laplace.cpp

It was sorta unclear whether you wanted the timestep to work such that each
step is the same, and on each step we update the object, or if we keep an
original copy of the object and just render a smoother object, doubling the
timestep each time (as in the movie).  I did the latter, although I don't think
it matters since if you understand one you understand the other (in fact,
I originally did the other way until I saw something in the lecture notes).
